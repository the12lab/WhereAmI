WhereAmI is a minimalist address reporting application. It simply tells you the closest address to your location. It is devoid of unnecessary content to avoid distraction and allow the address to be viewed at a glance. It is most often used in split-screen mode along with a navigator application.

 

The application uses less energy and no cell data as there are no maps to load, so the device battery lasts longer and doesn't eat into your high-bandwidth data allotment. Application size is quite small at under 2Mb.

 

As you approach the destination you may note the address numbers changing, so even in low visibility conditions or with obscured house numbers you can be sure of where you are without scanning buildings and mailboxes as you drive down an unfamiliar street. Rideshare users, and even bikers and walkers find it useful to hone in on the correct building faster. The application uses less energy and no cell data as there are no maps to load, so the device battery lasts longer and doesn't eat into your high-bandwidth data allotment.

 

A thin horizontal line indicates the location accuracy; smaller is better. Line is color coded (green is best, magenta is worst, orange is in-between, and blue if the data is stale).

 

Tap the clipboard to copy short address, long press to copy full address.


Day/night mode is supported with a simple tap on the background (away from the street name and building number, such as opposite the clipboard).
